# Class
'''
We use classes to define types.

A class is like a blueprint for creating objects
because it defines the structure and behavior that 
every object created from it will have. 
Just like a blueprint of a house shows 
what rooms, doors, and windows the house will have, 
a class describes what data (attributes) and actions (methods) an object should contain. 
When you create an object from a class, you are making a real instance based on that design, 
with its own values but the same structure. 
This makes code more organized, reusable, and easier to manage as programs grow.

# inheritance
# inheritance means a class can copy and use the features (variables and functions) of another parent class.
